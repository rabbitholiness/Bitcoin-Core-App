# External key

**Status: Early design exploration**

Wallet can be set up to be view only. We need to decide whether to offer some type of upgrade path to enable signing.

{% include picture.html
	image = "/assets/images/send/view-only.png"
	retina = "/assets/images/send/view-only@2x.png"
	big = "/assets/images/send/view-only-big.png"
	alt-text = "A send screen with a notice about the view-only state and options to upgrade to a signing wallet"
	width = 800
	height = 711
