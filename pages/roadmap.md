# Roadmap

The long-term goal for the application is to become a full-featured bitcoin wallet with broad support across operating systems and devices, and works for both casual use and specialized use cases.

## Internal versions

[Milestone 1]({{ '/milestones/1/' | relative_url }}) will be a simple node runner for desktop and mobile Android.

	alt-text = "Desktop and mobile layouts of an onboarding screen"
	width = 800
	height = 551
%}

[1.x milestones]({{ '/milestones/1-x/' | relative_url }}) will work towards essential wallet features and parity witht the existing QT application. [2.x milestones]({{ '/milestones/2-x/' | relative_url }}) are more open-ended and changes and features will be prioritized in the future.
